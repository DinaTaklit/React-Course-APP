## Get Started 

- To create the app use `npx create-react-app name_app`
- Install the packages for this project `npm install flux@3.1.3 react-router-dom@5.0.0 bootstrap@4.3.1`
- Install some tools to create Mock API `npm install -D cross-env@5.2.0 npm-run-all@4.1.5 json-server@0.15.0` => since tose tools are developement tools we add `-D` to be listed under dev dependencies when they're written to package.json, `corss-env` is a handy library for setting env vars, `npm-run-all` to run multiple scripts at the same time,`json-server` will serve our moch data.
